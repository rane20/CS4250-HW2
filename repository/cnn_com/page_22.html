        <h2 class="description">The Account is CNN’s home for powerful, narrative-driven audio storytelling. Featuring in-depth reporting from CNN journalists.
Our new season features CNN Senior Correspondent Donie O’Sullivan, who has been reporting on people with “crazy” beliefs for years. In this new, deeply personal podcast series, O’Sullivan confronts some crazy beliefs of his own. With help from cult survivors, psychologists, and families who’ve tried to pull loved ones out of the rabbit hole, O’Sullivan puts an empathetic lens on a fraught topic, debunks common misconceptions, and leaves listeners with practical takeaways for navigating this slippery world.</h2>

        <div slot="description"><p>What would you do if the person closest to you woke up believing something that sounded completely crazy? That’s what happened to Stephen Ghiglieri when his then- fiancée, Katrina Vaillancourt, became a Q-Anon believer overnight. But their story is a hopeful one. In part two of Persuadable, CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan explores one route out of conspiracy theory belief. </p>

              'This is the beginning of what is becoming an all-too-familiar story. Someone sees something online. It can be pretty mundane. It can even be factual, something about political corruption, or abuse, or a corporation doing a bad thing. But then, it gets more elaborate. A video explains how everything is connected, and everything is evil. There's a top-secret cabal running it all. That video leads to another, and another, and another. You've probably heard a story like this already. You might even know someone who's fallen down one of these internet rabbit holes. But what if that person is the person you are closest to in the world? What if it's your life partner? And what if their beliefs and values and convictions just seem to change overnight? What would you do?

              The second night, I started to go to bed in our bed, and I just said, I can't do this. Even though she wasn't doing anything, energetically, I just felt this frenetic thing that I just said, like, I got to get away from this. So I went and slept in the living room that night. And it was that sort of thing that I was seeing, hearing, feeling things that didn't feel like the woman that I had been living with. I asked her a question because I said, I really don't recognize who you are right now. You wouldn't hurt me in my sleep, would you?

              Katrina and Stephen lived in different homes for a couple of weeks. Really, they were living in different worlds. But neither of them were ready to cut the other off entirely. They just couldn't bring themselves to pull the plug on this relationship. And this is where this story goes from terrible and terribly familiar, if you know someone who's gone down the rabbit hole and their family has lost them, to something different, something hopeful. Katrina and Stephen moved back in together, to a neutral venue as it were, a rented house in the Arizona desert, itself a world away from their old life in San Francisco. Now what Stephen hadn't told Katrina at this point was that he was going to give this six months. Six months for Katrina to come around, for them to find a way to live together. Or he was gonna walk.

              Stephen knew they couldn't not talk about Katrina's new beliefs, because every day she had a new piece of information, a new revelation that she believed was important for him to know about. But Stephen also knew that they couldn't get through this if they talked about it all the time. So, they developed a bit of a system.

And while it didn't debunk everything I was seeing, it did impact some of the things I was seeing, which was part of the cracks that began to form in my sense of certainty.

              But even as those cracks were forming, Katrina was waiting. Waiting for one of the prophecies from the world of QAnon to turn out to be true. Waiting for Hillary Clinton to be arrested. Or waiting for JFK Jr. to show up and reveal he's not dead after all. Something like that would convince Stephen, she thought. It would prove to him that she was right. But the prophecies never became reality. And the more time that went by, the bigger the cracks in her confidence in QAnon became.

              Here's the thing about conspiracy theory beliefs. Most of us actually have them, and we can show you. You might wanna grab a pen or open the calculator on your phone for this next part. This is not gonna be hard math, I promise. There's a test in psychology called the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire. There are various tests like this, but this one is said to be particularly good at predicting people's susceptibility to conspiracy ideology, as it's called. There's five statements that you assign a number value to. If you think the statement is totally true, give us a hundred, because in your mind it's a hundred percent true. If you it's only half true, fifty percent, give it fifty. You get the idea. I took it, and so did a bunch of the people who were working on this show. And you can take it right now, too. Ready?

              Dr. Joseph Pierre is a professor and clinical psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco. He treats people with psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, but he's also carved out an expertise in a very specific area of psychology, one that looks at beliefs like Katrina's — like a lot of people's. Beliefs that we might call crazy, even though the people who believe them are, by Dr. Pierre's standards, not crazy. And so much of what he has studied and written about is useful for people who are in the situation Stephen and Katrina found themselves in. People who are asking, why does this person I love suddenly believe all of this stuff? How am I supposed to reason with them? And how do I not go crazy myself in the process? And first, he says, it helps to think about a spectrum of false beliefs, which are exactly that: a belief in something that is not true. On the one end of the spectrum, there are the kinds of false belief that we all have.

              Conspiracy theories are mostly about external events that are happening in the world or historical events, not so much the believer. And the evidence isn't that I heard a voice or I had a bodily sensation that made me feel a certain way. The evidence is some information that we find out there in the world, whether it's people tell us or we go online and we find it there. On the surface, it looks like something very similar to what I would treat in my job as a psychiatrist. But if you look at surveys of how many people on the planet believe in conspiracy theories, surveys consistently find that well over half of the population believes in at least one.

              This is something we've come back to a lot making this show, this idea that believing in conspiracy theories, even ones that sound completely unbelievable, doesn't mean that somebody is mentally ill, but it also doesn't that they're mentally healthy. Often people who are in deep holes of conspiracy belief are struggling, just like Katrina was in 2020. All of this is very helpful for getting to a place where you can have some empathy for somebody who believes things that you don't, which is great. But how do you take that next step to have an effective conversation with somebody who is assuring you, and correctly most likely, that they are not crazy while they're also telling you things that sound completely crazy?

              And if you start from that perspective, then you're done because we're all, I think, kind of primed to defend our beliefs and particularly when those beliefs become integrated or fused with our identities. Because when that happens, and this is true oftentimes of religious beliefs or ideological beliefs, or in some cases like with QAnon conspiracy theory beliefs, if I'm going to concede, oh my gosh, I'm wrong. You know, what does that mean? It means that not only is my belief wrong, but because it's become fused with my identity, I'm sort of fundamentally wrong. Or what I've been doing for the past five years as I've been immersed in this subculture, that's been a waste of time. And that's, you know, people aren't likely to just give that up right away. You can't start off the bat with, let's talk about how you're wrong, right? You have to start with the understanding part and kind of mapping out the belief and why do you believe that? And that then opens up an opportunity to then have a dialogue about it and potentially to challenge the belief, but that's going to take some time.

But when they become sort of absorbing, and we're spending all of our time revolved around this belief, that's where things can be more difficult.

              And that's where Katrina had found herself, struggling under the weight of a lot of fear and starting to recognize the damage her beliefs were doing to her relationships. She said she had to get there herself, but she was only able to do it because Stephen gave her the time to get to there. And he loved her throughout.

              I accept now that uncertainty exists, and I stopped trying to be certain of the things I'm uncertain of. Uncertainty will always be here, it's not something to solve or fix.

              You know, there's a perception, at least at the moment, that conspiracy theories are everywhere, that we're in a golden age of conspiracy theories. Is there evidence for that? And I mean, why does it feel so dire right now.

              I think there's reasonable evidence that the kinds of conspiracy theories that people believe are more consequential. They matter. It's not just about JFK being assassinated. Now it's about climate change being a hoax or vaccines don't work. They cause more disease than they cure. Those are really more concerning beliefs that can have a clear negative impact on both individuals, but also the fate of society. Maybe we're not living in a golden age of conspiracy theories in terms of them being more prolific, but perhaps you could make an argument that we're living in dark age of conspiracy theories because they're more imminently consequential and have more of a potentially negative impact.

              Yeah, it's an excellent question. It's the million dollar question.

I think there's ways that we can dig ourselves out. But now I think it will be harder to do so. And mostly the writing on the wall that I see is really headed in an opposite direction.

              I think Dr. Pierre is probably right. A lot of people do lose the ones they love to this stuff. Colleen Protzman, who we met in Episode 1, never got her son Michael back. And I've met a lot more Colleen Protzmans than I've meet Katrina and Stephen. Stephen and Katrina are now married, but what worked for them isn't going to work for everybody. They had a lot working in their favor. They had the time and the literal space to figure out a way to coexist. Katrina had trained in coaching people to get through conflict and that, in a way, allowed her to step outside of her own beliefs and see things from Stephen's perspective. And then there's the fact that, however much Stephen might have disagreed with Katrina, even found the beliefs she held for a while abhorrent, none of them were targeted at him. And I realize as I talk to you about approaching people and ideas with empathy that that is a very difficult ask if you yourself and your family and the people you love are the target of the hate that is so often tied up in conspiracy theory belief. But one thing I would say is that I've met a lot of people who go down these rabbit holes, and they're not going in there as homophobic people, as extremely racist people or going in there with a lot of hate. So many of them go into these rabbit holes out of fear. And so maybe some of these people aren't as lost to us as we might think. As bad as things are, or at least as they seem to be, as Dr. Pierre says, there are some things we can all do to help dig ourselves and each other out of this. Because even if, so far, you feel like you can't relate, you haven't had a loved one fall down a conspiracy rabbit hole and feel like you could never fall down one yourself, you're not off the hook yet. Because this does affect all of us.
