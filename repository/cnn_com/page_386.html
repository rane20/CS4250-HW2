                            Late one night in the fall of 2012, 17-year-old Brittany Aragon overdosed. She took four Valium pills, lay down in bed and waited.

                            While Larry Nassar was sexually abusing gymnasts in the back room of Twistars Gymnastics in Lansing, Michigan, Geddert – the famed Olympic coach and then-owner of the gym – was subjecting them to a different kind of horror: routinely ignoring their injuries and verbally assaulting them, according to former gymnasts and their families.

Another says he failed to get her medical attention after she broke her neck at practice, an injury she said the doctor told her could have left her paralyzed. A third gymnast said Geddert made her train on a broken leg for nearly a month when she was 13. Two teenage gymnasts attempted suicide. All the young women who spoke to CNN said he repeatedly disregarded their injuries.

                            “John was always scary, even when he wasn’t my coach yet,” said gymnast Bailey Lorencen. “He would be throwing water bottles at the girls in the gym and get in their face and scream at them.”

                            Geddert coached through fear, his gymnasts say – and his abuse often led them to seek emotional comfort with Nassar, the doctor at Twistars.

                            “Larry would act like he cared about us,” said Brittany, who is speaking out for the first time since her overdose six years ago. Many gymnasts complained about Geddert to Nassar, she remembered, and Nassar would tell them, “This is just how John is, he wants the best for you.”

                            Nassar and Geddert worked together for nearly 20 years. They were longtime friends; Geddert was in <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/22181248/usa-gymnastics-suspends-former-olympics-coach-john-geddert-tied-larry-nassar?redirected=true">Nassar’s wedding party</a> in 1996. The following year, a Twistars parent told Geddert about Nassar’s behavior, alleging sexual abuse, assault and molestation, according to a federal lawsuit. The suit, which is ongoing, says Geddert took no responsible action.

                            The sport’s governing body, USA Gymnastics, first learned about Nassar’s abuse in the summer of 2015 and started an investigation. Even after USAG fired Nassar that summer – and Michigan State University fired him the following year – Geddert continued to support him. In September 2016, Geddert was <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/09/12/former-usa-gymnastics-doctor-accused-abuse/89995734/">quoted</a> as saying Nassar is “an extremely professional physician” who “goes above and beyond” for his gymnasts.

                            During his time treating gymnasts at Twistars, Nassar protected Geddert as well. Parents of gymnasts said he tried to persuade them not to file charges for Geddert’s alleged abusive behavior. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4423403-Nassar-FB-Messages-October-2013.html">Documents obtained by CNN</a> show that Nassar tried to intervene after one woman filed a police report against Geddert, saying he pushed her granddaughter against a wall and stepped on her foot.

                            In 2013, USAG received a letter from a former Twistars coach detailing complaints of verbal and physical abuse by Geddert, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4423422-Letter-to-USAG.html">documents obtained by CNN</a>. The letter said Geddert “coaches and lives in a narcissistic manner” and “should not be allowed to coach gymnastics.”

To be the best, we believed kids need to be coached with a certain degree of threatening. John was really good at pitting parents against each other to keep it that way. He wanted control over what the parents and kids said or did. And if you stood up to him, your kid would pay.”

                            Practices at Twistars were long, running from 3:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., five days a week, the gymnasts said, and Geddert wouldn’t accept any excuses to skip practice. They covered their bleeding hands in chalk for skills on the bars, and their bruised limbs landed on the beam time and time again, the five women remembered. Anyone who came late had to climb the rope to the ceiling using only their arms.

                            For gymnasts with dreams of scholarships, competing at an elite level or even going professional, Geddert is almost unavoidable, gymnasts and their parents told CNN. His website boasts his accomplishments: 17-time state, regional or national coach of the year, 2011 USA World Championship team head coach, 2012 USA National Elite coach of the year and, most famously, the coach who led Jordyn Wieber and USA’s “Fierce Five” gymnastics team to Olympic gold in 2012 in London.

                            In 2012, when Makayla was 16, Nassar diagnosed her with a severe case of mononucleosis, her mother said. She missed 56 days of school, but Geddert would not let her miss a single day at the gym.

                            In early 2013, while she was still sick with mono, Makayla was told to do a release skill, swinging between bars of alternating heights. Her mother had come to watch that day and remembered seeing her swing from the high bar. Makayla was supposed to let go and catch the low bar, but instead Geddert grabbed her mid-air and threw her onto the low bar, Makayla recounted in her victim impact statement at Nassar’s sentencing. The injury left her with a black eye, swollen lymph nodes and stomach pain.

When her father, Ken, came to pick her up, he said, Geddert didn’t tell him about the fall. He only learned about it from his daughter’s friends later.

                            Police records show that Geddert completed counseling after the 2013 incident. In a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4416249-Apology-Letter-March-2014.html">letter to the young gymnast exclusively obtained by CNN</a>, Geddert wrote: “I was informed our conference in the locker room on October 16, 2013, frightened you. That was not my intent when we met for approximately 45 seconds. I was genuinely concerned about your safety during the exercises and held your arm to impress upon you the need to perform the exercises properly to minimize the risk of serious injury.”

                            “I can say with certainty that John Geddert should not be allowed to coach gymnastics,” the former coach wrote. “I am truly concerned for the well-being of the athletes under his care. He coaches and lives in a narcissistic manner, attempting to control others by means of fear and intimidation. I have witnessed the use and abuse of multiple gymnasts under Geddert’s care and have concerns for their bodies, health, interests and overall psychosocial development.”

                            The letter was provided to Don Brooks, the independent investigator hired by USAG in February 2014 to investigate the complaints detailed in the former coach’s letter.

                            Between February and May of 2014, Brooks interviewed gymnasts and their families. He would not discuss the details of those interviews but confirmed that much of the letter was corroborated.

                            By the end of May 2014, he sent his findings to USAG. Among them, Brooks said, were Brittany’s suicide attempt and the incident at Twistars that left Makayla with a black eye, swollen lymph nodes and stomach pain.

According to documents obtained by CNN, Brooks let them know that Geddert met with Steve Penny and a USAG board member. “As a result of their meeting,” Brooks wrote, “Geddert has agreed to make changes in his coaching style. Specific directions and expectations were crafted for Geddert.”

                            USAG confirmed Geddert’s suspension earlier this year citing article 10.5 of its bylaws, allowing interim measures to be imposed to ensure gymnast safety in the presence of sufficiently serious allegations. But the organization said it could not comment further “as this is a pending matter.”  USAG reiterated its commitment to athlete safety and creating an empowering culture for its gymnasts.

                            Brittany Aragon left Twistars in the summer of 2013, 11 months after she overdosed. That August, she started college at Western Michigan University. But even there, 70 miles away from Geddert’s gym, she said she couldn’t escape him.

                            When she arrived at WMU, Geddert’s friend was no longer coaching there, so he called the new coach, Penny Jernigan.

Brittany was one of them. “When he talked about Brittany, his tone changed,” she said. “He complained about her and said she doesn’t like hard work.”
