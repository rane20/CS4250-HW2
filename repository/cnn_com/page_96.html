              So yeah, what exactly is this path that we're on? What does this mean for you and your finances? And is it possible to get clarity in the chaos? I'm Audie Cornish, and this is The Assignment. OK, here's the state of play. We are about a week into the president's 90 day pause on tariffs, which, despite the name, didn't actually suspend all tariffs. It just reduced most of them to 10 percent across the board on everyone except China. The president has slapped a 145 percent tariff there, and the Chinese have responded with a 125 percent tariff of their own. It's a lot to process. And to help us make sense of all this, is CNN senior business writer, Alison Morrow. She's the author of the Business Nightcap Newsletter. Hey there, Alison. Welcome to the assignment.  So you are like technically the busiest person in the office right now, which is saying something.

              'Then it's everyone's interests, right? I was thinking about the last time I covered an economic crisis, it was coming out of the 2008 presidential campaign and that sense of like, can I sell my home? What's happening to my retirement? What's going on? There was a real kind of panic and even, and with banks collapsing, it really felt like this very striking moment. In this situation, it also is striking, but you have someone like Janet Yellen saying, hey, this was self-inflicted. Basically, this is a self-own. So talk about what's the difference between what happened then in terms of leading us to this moment and what has happened now.

They stepped on a financial rake and it threatened the economy. Um, but this is weird. Like Trump brought his own rake.

              He brought his own rake and this is not a systemic problem that's built over years. The economy was in really technically good shape nearing the end of the Biden administration. Inflation was a little higher than we liked and there were some cracks starting to form in the labor market. But in general, the labor market was good. Unemployment was low. We're still growing at a solid clip. Consumers are spending money. There was good confidence in the economy and all of that almost overnight  has shattered. And we're starting to see those, those cracks widen and it's causing a lot of alarm, you know, we've seen recession forecasters say the odds of a recession have gone up tremendously since Trump came into office and these tariffs that he was campaigning on have been so much worse than anyone could have predicted.

              'Not to alarm you, but, you know, we knew going in what Trump says his tariff plan is going to be and how he views tariffs as a kind of economic catch-all policy. And he's going to bring industrialization back to America while also bringing other nations to heel. Never mind that those two goals are completely in contradiction to one another. But once they were actually announced, and that was just two weeks ago, if you can believe that. The levies were higher than analysts, economists, investors expected. That's why we've seen the markets freak out the way they have. And the haphazard nature, not only of the way that they were calculated, but the way the way have been implemented and communicated from the White House. Markets are hanging on every word the White house says and they are getting conflicting messages every other day from trade advisors, from the commerce secretary, from the president himself.

It may be, I think, the pain nerves, it's particularly sensitive, but it is not the economy, but one of the things we do here at CNN that I found fascinating is a fear and greed index, which is this, it looks kind of like, you know, the car meter and it's either all the way on extreme fear or all the way on extremely greed, which is amazing because neither of those sound good. But this is the chart you have given us. Talk about this chart.

              Well, I actually just wrote a story about it two weeks ago, because it's gotten so much attention on social media and elsewhere lately, and I was like, where did this, it's been around for a while, but it's important to note fear and greed are not our construction. That is like a common measure of market sentiment. But I think they're instructive. When you think about greed, okay, people are buying, investors want more and more more. That is driving the market forward. And when people are scared, they're fearful, they're selling, selling, and selling. So those two kind of opposing forces are often the thing pulling stocks one way or another. And lately, it's been very firmly in the extreme fear territory because we've seen tariffs take hold and make investors really scared of a recession.

May not be a recession, ultimately, but the behavior is one guided by and anticipation of a slowdown, which can have a self-fulfilling prophecy element to it because if the market continues to slow down, economic growth will stagnate as a result. Businesses will grow less because they'll have less capital investment. You will see economists being a bit conservative and saying, well, it's basically a coin flip at this point. It went from maybe at the start of the year, a remote. 15% chance or 20% chance, depending on who you ask. Now, a lot of mainstream economists, they're saying it's basically a coin flip.

              'We're talking with Alison Morrow, senior business writer at CNN. Stay with us. You know, in the Atlantic, somebody was writing that this whirlwind, right, of all of these different tariffs, that it's paralyzed businesses, rattled markets, et cetera. But the line that drew me was most of the damage will not be undone by Trump's tariff pause, referring to the fact that he put a 90-day pause on these tariffs. It says the world has seen things it cannot unsee. What do you hear when you hear that sentence? Because you've been in this business world for a long time covering what has been revealed in this moment that was startling for everyone about the, I don't know, whether the American financial emperor has no clothes.

              The word unprecedented gets overused so much in this administration. But it's not just the tariffs. It is also the perception of an erosion of the rule of law in this country. And it is hard to overstate how important stability and predictability is for global investment and how much the US has benefited from America historically being the responsible adult. Who always pays its bills, who manages its economy responsibly. The turmoil that we saw in the bond market, again, without getting into the technicalities of it, was a shaking of trust with the world. Suddenly the world doesn't trust that America knows what it's doing.

So let's talk about this because now this is when we hear about the various meetings between the Trump White House and other countries and what that's supposed to mean for their tariffs. But like when you guys put it that way I was like, oh yeah, that's a lot of deals to make one-on-one. And what are you, again, seeing that shows, like people don't have faith he can do it, or that they do, because a lot of people, Trump supporters, lept to his defense to say, you don't understand, this has brought everyone to us, everyone to the table, they all want to make a deal. He's doing what he said he would do and it's working.

We're just gonna sit this one out. Like, investors, put your pencils down. We are taking our money out of the stock market. We are not making any big moves because we don't know where the risk is here and we don' have a lot confidence. That the Trump administration can pull off what it claims to be trying to pull off.

And when Trump and his Treasury Secretary talk about I think it's Scott Bessent t basically said like, the American dream is not cheap goods. And I was thinking like, yeah, it is actually. I think like that is how this has all been sold. Like you can't buy a house, but you can get a TV. You know what I mean? You can't, like maybe it's gonna take you a while to buy a car, but you will have a Nintendo. And we were all like okay with that social contract.

So when that falters, it's a real problem and governments historically have bent over backwards to try to prevent. Americans from losing confidence so much that they, you know, I think during COVID was a great example.

You know, the cheap baubles line, I was like, it's the bulk of what most Americans are buying, you know, I think it's interesting from the millionaires and billionaires in the Trump administration to lecture Americans about cheap baubles and prioritizing cheap goods over American industry.

              Like on late night television, they're showing it, right? Like it's an inescapable conversation. Though I wouldn't take advice from someone at the gym about just wholesale financial decisions.

              Yeah, I mean, I guess she knows I'm a business reporter, so she was like, what should I do? And I was like talk to a professional, you know, that might be a money manager and or a therapist, like these are tough times. And you know I would say as like an elder millennial who my career started at the beginning of the financial crisis, and we lived through that, and there was a lot of pain. And then there was COVID. And we don't know the long effects that this is going to take. You know, I read something this morning that really stuck with me in Semaphore's newsletter where Liz Hoffman talked about the financial shock is not measured by its immediate impact. It's measured by the blast radius, right? Like in 2008, it started with subprime mortgages, which no mainstream people had ever heard of that. And then it had all these ripple effects that took months and months and even years to play out. And it took a long time to recover. COVID was a much shorter, sharper shock, lots of externalities, but ultimately a quick recovery. Sometimes these things happen and they are massively scary and they ripple out for years. And sometimes they happen and nothing much happens afterward. And it's impossible to know in the moment, in the shock, what we're going to get at the end of it. So I would just keep that in mind. It can be easy. I fall into it when things are so tumultuous. It's like, oh, we're all doomed. But that's a bad spiral, I think, for personal mental health and for society at large.
