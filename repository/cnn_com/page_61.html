              'When he accused Columbia University of tolerating anti-Semitism and demanded it change its policies around protests and masks, place its Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership, and give campus police new arrest powers or risk losing hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding, Columbia appeared to comply and made a series of policy changes and enhanced restrictions on demonstrations. Critics saw that as caving to the Trump administration's demands. But university leadership then sent a note to students saying it would not allow the government to quote, require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy and would reject any orchestration that could damage the institution or reforms. It is also promised to address concerns about antisemitism and discrimination. Well, earlier this week, Harvard University facing similar threats said we're not budging.

And looking at it long-term in the future, I had to weigh between taking on a little bit of debt, going to Harvard, and graduating debt-free from undergraduate from the University of Tulsan, that's a tough decision. Like I was genuinely worried that Harvard would not be in the place that it is today in 10, 20, 30 years because of the decisions of the administration and lack of decisions and some of the key issues facing the community today.

That because of funding, because of money, we're gonna allow ununiformed officers to come in and arrest people whose speech we disagree with. We're gonna to allow and support definitions of anti-Semitism that some include very legitimate criticisms of the Israeli government because of an administration who wants to use leverage against a private university to accomplish their goals, which is to dismantle the elite and what are viewed as liberal chambers and institutions.

It's not very popular to be a Harvard student right now. I come from the middle of rural conservative Oklahoma. And a lot of people have told me, don't let those liberals up at Harvard change you or turn you villainous or whatever you want it to be. And that's OK. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But it comes with a set of both expectations and ideas from what we see in the news every day about the elite liberal establishment and the Harvard elites and liberal echo chambers. Since some of it is very. Very legitimate criticisms. Like, I have a problem with where I am because of it's so leaning conservative that it's tough to have left-leaning ideas and to have prudence in them where I'm. And the same applies for conservative leaning people at a place like Harvard. I think a college should have a diffusion of ideas and challenge the way you believe.

They foster legitimate criticism. Anti-Semitism is a serious problem on Harvard's campus, and it needs to be resolved. And the administration at Harvard has been slow and inept at doing it. They're in the right track, but I think we're seeing a course correct towards a positive direction right now instead of a negative direction. One that is being fraught with threat, with defunding, and with a movement against intellectualism as a whole. And so I think we can really hit two birds with one stone, remain an independent institution, and solve these big legitimate problems at the school. And I think Harvard is doing that.

              So, Harvard is really the first higher ed institution to push back so strongly against the administration. And what we're seeing now is this escalated full frontal assault from every direction. Monday night, you know, we see this freeze on more than $2 billion of funding for the university. Tuesday, we hear from Trump that the IRS should really revoke the university's exemption status. Now, Wednesday, we hear from the IRS, some CNN original reporting that the IRS is looking into how they can pull the university's tax exemption status. Hours after that, DHS announces that they're considering pulling the certification Harvard needs to allow international students to actually be admitted at Harvard. International students make up more than a quarter of the university student population. So it's really, as the days go on, and we're seeing Harvard stick to their stance, but at the same time, we haven't seen any action, no litigation yet. They're just holding their ground and trying to figure out internally what this funding freeze means for them.

              Well, it's really unclear how the university would then be classified by the IRS. That's a big question mark that still remains unknown. Typically, when the exemption status changes, which, by the way, is extremely rare, it usually starts with a full audit. We're not sure where the timeline stands on this, but we know the IRS is working on it. But it means... Harvard would pay taxes. And obviously that affects their bottom line and they have to come up with that money. And they've already had a significant amount of funding frozen.

              Yeah, so it's actually much more complicated than that. They do have this massive endowment, but from our research we found that at least 70 percent of their endowment funds are actually already earmarked for donor designated purposes. So they are actually legally required to use that money for what it's been designated for. So it's not just a free pot of money that they can reallocate.

              'And a lot of that is supported by federal funding for decades. And last year, we found that Harvard received nearly $700 million in sponsored funding from the federal government and has more than 1,500 NIH grants that are multi-year. A lot of these things are being affected by this freeze. And it's something that, again, affects this research that... Hits the community society at large, and that's in addition to the economic situation in Boston, you know, Harvard is a massive employer of people in that city and around the area.

              So again, this is a largely unprecedented situation, and there's no clear or obvious path that Harvard can take. But there's a good shot that this ends up in the court system. And that could be Harvard taking the fight to the administration and filing a federal lawsuit, asking the court to intervene and to stop the government from unlawfully freezing their funding that affects so much of their operation. We haven't seen that yet, but legal experts have told me that they could possibly succeed on a case based on First Amendment protections or retaliation. If you look at the timeline, it was only hours after Harvard took a stand that the administration did freeze their funding. While we haven't see Harvard make their move in court yet, we did see some preemptive action from a group of Harvard faculty members. In a lawsuit they filed against the administration, trying to preempt the funding freeze because the administration has been threatening for weeks now to take away Harvard funding. That litigation hasn't moved forward. We haven't seen any action there. And we have to wonder, is that group actually now waiting to take its next steps based on what the university does?

              And so whatever Harvard ends up doing, whether it's in the courts or other ways for them to secure funding, is that kind of a playbook for these other schools to say, hey, we can kind of model this if the Trump administration comes for us in such a severe way like they've done here.

              In this unprecedented time, Harvard will likely serve as a roadmap for other institutions that could be gearing up for their own fight with the administration. Another option Harvard can choose, like some other universities that have sort of acquiesced to the administration with quiet compliance to their policy changes and those demands, Harvard could negotiate here and that might prove to be a more sustainable option. We do know that Harvard hired conservative lawyers who are known to have Republican ties. And while we don't know for sure, these litigators might be the channel that Harvard hopes to use to broker some kind of sustainable solution with the administration, or at least cool down the tensions. Seeing Harvard pivot in that way would probably signal to other institutions to follow suit, and we'll have to see how that plays out.
