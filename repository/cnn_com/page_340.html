                            As he clutched the steering wheel of his mom’s Honda Civic, Easy Chang could feel the anger welling inside him, piercing the haze of Xanax from the pill he’d popped earlier.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            A man in a crosswalk had just shouted a profanity at him after Chang sped past, coming too close for the man’s comfort.

                            Chang turned the car around and reached for the Smith &amp; Wesson .38 he had with him that day.

                            He took aim, squeezed the trigger, drove closer, then fired again.

                            Tarek Oueslati, an engineering student, collapsed on Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco. He was shot through the chest.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Four years later, Chang is now repentant. He says it’s a crime he would not have committed if the gun had been registered in his name.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            “There’s a market for that – people that don’t want paper trails. You know what I mean?” he told CNN. “With legal guns, you’re always thinking ‘This gun’s on paper. This gun’s on paper.’ … You have to think twice before you do anything.”
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            A CNN investigation into the unregulated sale of firearms found that unlicensed dealers flout the nation’s gun laws and provide a steady flow of weapons to people like Chang, who are either barred from owning guns, or want guns that can’t be traced back to them.
                        </p>

                            Unlicensed dealers are difficult to detect, tough to prosecute, and often receive lenient sentences even when convicted, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former federal agents and prosecutors across the country.

                            “I know from my own personal experience as an investigator that a lot of firearms that I’ve seen recovered in violent crimes have come through the hands of unlicensed dealers,” said Thomas Chittum, a veteran agent and top supervisor at the headquarters for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Washington, DC.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            “Some get prosecuted,” Chittum said. “I would say most do not.”

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            At the heart of the problem is a vaguely worded federal statute that has frustrated efforts by law enforcement to combat the problem of illegal gun dealing, and effectively helps sustain a marketplace for black market gun sales. The law is fuzzy on the distinction between a casual seller of firearms who is not required to conduct background checks on prospective buyers and a gun dealer, who is.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            It’s a problem that law enforcement officials and gun control advocates say would be greatly mitigated by the passage of proposed universal background check legislation that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/house-vote-gun-background-check/index.html">passed in the House</a> last month. The issue could come up in the Senate next week, when the judiciary committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on another gun control measure.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            CNN reviewed dozens of cases of illegal dealing across the country, including some in which sellers were warned by the ATF that they might be breaking the law, but continued selling firearms nonetheless.

                            The sellers were in many cases unlikely suspects: upstanding, seemingly law-abiding citizens with no previous criminal record.

                            Terry Hunt, the family patriarch, served for years as master of The Washington State Grange, a statewide charitable organization with an emphasis on service to the agricultural community. His wife, Mary, served three terms as an elected county commissioner from 1998 to 2010.

                            The family owns and operates a sprawling, 25,000-acre wheat and cattle ranch and one of their adult sons, Rusty, runs a game hunting guide service for “trophy deer,” pheasant and other animals on the property.

                            The Hunts also bought and sold guns – lots of them. They’d been doing it for years. Terry Hunt would buy weapons in Washington state at a discount, then sell them at a gun show held several times a year in Reno, Nevada.

                            In April of 2012 – more than two years before Oueslati was shot – Terry Hunt got a visit from an ATF agent.

                            The agent told Hunt that “his buying and selling of firearms had brought him to the attention of the ATF as someone who is dealing in firearms without a license,” according to a federal search warrant affidavit recounting the conversation.

                            Under federal law, gun dealers are required to be licensed. They are required to conduct background checks on prospective customers and to maintain records on all weapons they acquire and sell. The background check component of the law is designed to ensure that dealers don’t sell to convicted felons, domestic abusers or people who are mentally unstable.

                            The agent, Heidi Wallace, told Hunt that some of his guns had been recovered at crime scenes in California. She asked him about a pair of hand guns he’d bought in 2008 and 2010 that were later seized by the FBI in San Francisco.

                            Hunt told Wallace he didn’t remember to whom he’d sold the guns, but acknowledged selling weapons at the Big Reno gun show – an event frequented by residents of California, which has much stricter gun laws than Nevada.

                            Hunt told the agent he would probably do the next three gun shows in Reno then call it quits. She countered that he could not continue doing business as he’d done in the past.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            As a private citizen without a federal firearms license, Wallace explained, he was prohibited from buying weapons under his own name with the intent of selling them to someone else, the affidavit states. This is something only licensed dealers are permitted to do, she said. She added that it was a violation of federal law for him to sell guns to anyone who was not a resident of his own state.

                            She then handed Hunt a letter. It was entitled “WARNING NOTICE OF UNLICENSED FIREARMS DEALING VIOLATION.”

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            “This letter serves to officially advise you to cease and desist engaging in the business of dealing in firearms until you have sought and obtained a Federal firearms license,” it read.

                            The assault on Oueslati made headlines in the Bay Area: It was a shocking crime, a brazen road rage attack that stood in stark contrast to the city’s tranquil vibe. It was carried out just a few blocks from a row of iconic Victorian homes, known as the Painted Ladies, often featured in postcards of the city’s skyline. One witness told police the shooter smiled as he opened fire.

                            For weeks, as Oueslati recovered in the hospital, the case went unsolved. Then police caught a break. An alert SFPD sergeant, Thomas Ly, spotted a gray Honda Civic similar to the one that appeared in security camera footage that captured parts of the incident.

                            Ly ran the license plate, which was registered to a woman who lived with her two sons about six blocks from where Oueslati was shot. Ly then compared pictures of the sons to a composite sketch of the suspect.

                            Both bore “several similarities” to the sketch, Ly wrote. The sergeant then compiled a photo lineup featuring both brothers’ driver’s license photos, along with those of four other men, and showed them to a witness.

Lee, in a brief interview outside his home, told CNN he had not been to the Big Reno gun show in years, but declined to answer questions. “I have nothing to say on that,” Lee said. “That’s in the past.”

                            At one point during Chan’s interrogation, investigators showed him a series of photos.

                            “These are Bay Area people – close by,” an investigator said as he displayed one picture after another. “Would it surprise you that they’ve all been caught with guns that have come from the exact same place all your guns have come from?

                            “It’s not a coincidence,” the same investigator added moments later.

                            The investigators also pressed Chan on whether he met up with Chang in the hours after Oueslati was shot.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Chan initially told investigators he never saw his friend that afternoon. But when confronted with texts indicating that he was waiting outside Easy’s apartment building about an hour after the shooting and that Easy was on his way down to meet him, Chan changed his story.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            He admitted that he saw Easy emerge from his apartment and go grab something from his car.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            “Did you see anything in his hands?” one investigator asked. “Was he holding anything?”

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            “Cigarettes,” Chan answered. He said Easy then went back inside his apartment and that was the last he saw of him that day.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            An investigator asked Chan about the whereabouts of the .38 that came from the empty box that traced back to the Hunts. He insisted he had no idea what became of that gun.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Nearly a year later, police ran a computer query on the weapon and discovered that it had been sold by Chan’s younger brother who was also his roommate at the time, according to records.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            The transaction occurred three days after Chan’s interrogation.

                            Once police discovered the sale of the .38, they obtained a search warrant and seized the weapon from the buyer. In the warrant affidavit, Sgt. Ly wrote that he suspected Chang of using the gun to shoot Oueslati.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Police had it tested against a slug recovered from the scene, but it came back inconclusive – the weapon could neither be confirmed nor eliminated as having fired the bullet.

                            The case, which received coverage in the Wenatchee World and other local media outlets, “resulted in much shame and embarrassment” for the family, Terry Hunt’s lawyer would later write in a court filing.

                            Prosecutors accused the Hunts of selling approximately 465 guns worth more than $270,000 at the Big Reno gun show after the 2012 warning was issued. They intentionally catered to people who were prohibited from purchasing firearms for one reason or another, prosecutors alleged.

                            Prosecutors also expected another person to testify: A man identified in court papers by the initials M.O. CNN has identified him as Michael Odello, a construction manager and one-time high school softball coach from the upscale seaside city of Carmel, California.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Odello, a gun enthusiast and avid hunter, met the Hunts at the Big Reno gun show in the late 80s. He became friendly with the family and helped them set up for shows from 2008 through 2012.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            He also purchased multiple guns from “one or more” Hunt family members, including some weapons that were illegal in California, according to court records. Authorities used this as leverage to get him to cooperate.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Odello’s statements to investigators were summarized by prosecutors in a court filing: He told agents the Hunts would purchase weapons they knew would be “hot sellers” in advance of gun shows.  They offered the lowest prices and “never did paperwork.” For these reasons, Odello said, they made a profit even when business was slow.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            He said 90 percent of the family’s business came from repeat customers, including a group of “Asian males” with whom the normally chatty Hunts were “business oriented and not social.”
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Odello said he witnessed the Asian men buy as many as 15 handguns — new and in the box — at one time. He saw five or six such transactions over the course of a single weekend.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            The Hunts sometimes conducted clandestine transactions “they did not want viewed from the [gun show] floor,” Odello told agents, according to the summary.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            On one occasion in 2010, he said, he allowed Rusty Hunt to use his hotel room to conduct a deal with one Asian man. Odello said he watched as Hunt emptied a duffel bag full of guns onto the bed – approximately ten guns, new and in their boxes, worth about $6,000.

                            As the case headed for trial, prosecutors sought to present evidence of firearms recoveries they said were the end result of the Hunts’ alleged illegal gun dealing. At least 16 weapons, they wrote, were sold after the 2012 warning and later turned up at “crime-related scenes” across the Bay Area and as far away as New York City.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            They even prepared a “mafia-style chart” showing the flow of firearms with the Hunts at the top, according to one court filing.

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            In the end, however, the years-long probe into the Hunts’ gun sales ended with more of a whimper than a bang.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            In September of 2017, the Hunts agreed to plead guilty, but to a lesser, obscure-sounding misdemeanor charge called aiding and abetting a false entry by a firearms dealer. The agreement centered on the straw purchases in which Terry Hunt paid a friend to purchase guns on his behalf as part of the family’s “conspiracy to illegally sell firearms without a federal firearms license.” But the deal required no prison time. Each family member was sentenced to five years of probation.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            The deal was struck, in part, due to misleading wording on an ATF gun dealer application that incorrectly stated that people selling guns only at gun shows need not apply for a federal firearms license.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cnnix__article__paragraph">
                            Despite the warning delivered by the ATF agent in 2012, Terry Hunt’s lawyer would argue years later that his elderly client was confused by what the agent told him and the seemingly contradictory language on the application she handed him.

                            Sitting in a Starbucks in his hometown of Carmel, California one morning in November, Odello quietly scanned the seven-page court filing that summarized what the ATF says he told them about the Hunts.

Neither man was ever charged in connection with the Hunt’s gun sales. Nor was Chan.

                            CNN reached out to the Hunt family in emails and through phone calls to various family members and their attorneys.

                            In court papers submitted prior to sentencing, Terry Hunt’s attorney, Richard Bechtolt, argued that Hunt did not see himself as a gun dealer, based on the language in the federal statute cited in the ATF warning letter.

                            The statute says anyone “engaged in the business” of selling firearms requires a license. “Engaged in the business” is defined as devoting “time, attention and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.”

                            The law states that it does not apply to someone engaged in only occasional gun sales or collectors or hobbyists adding to, or selling from, their personal collection.

                            “To Mr. Hunt’s way of thinking,” Bechtolt wrote, “he did not engage in the sale of firearms for livelihood and profit as his occupation was a farmer and this was a hobby.”
