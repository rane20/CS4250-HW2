Source: Federal Employment Agency FACTS &amp; FIGURES p. 54 PUBLICATION DETAILS UNDER GERMAN L AW p. 56 Dear Readers, When Bilge Atici travels abroad, he feels homesick for Germany. “But when I come back and open my front door, I feel like I’m home again.” Bilge is an en­ gineer who has lived near Munich since 2019 where she works for an aerospace company. She’s one of many international skilled workers who have chosen to make a life for themselves in Germany. They value the career prospects, not least in key future­oriented fields such as artificial intelligence and green energy. But it’s not just about work: they appreciate the high quality of life, Germany’s welfare system and excellent opportunities for further training and development. Germany is making it attractive for skilled workers to move here, such as through wide­ranging legal reforms which remove obstacles to migration. Find out what that means for you in this issue of Deutschland.de - The Magazine. We also inter­ viewed Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil, who told us about the importance of the new Opportunities Card. Elsewhere we take a look at Egypt, where an Egyptian­German advice centre helps skilled workers prepare for a future in Ger­ many. At the same time, Germany is lending a hand to partner countries which are creating vocational training systems along the lines of Germany’s dual system. SKILLS FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES Germany is helping young people gain prac- tical experience in their home countries. p. 50 We’ll also introduce you to people like Bilge Atici, people who work in many differ­ ent industries and come from all over the world. But what they all have in com­ mon is that they now feel at home here in Germany. We can’t wait to introduce you to Germany, the opportunity hotspot! Best wishes, the Editors 3 </div>

Text: Sarah Kanning1 Great towns and cities to live in From climbing walls in the office and free e-bikes to workplace nurseries, German businesses come up with many great ways to encourage highly qualified staff to move to jobs outside ma- jor cities. Medium-sized cities like Erlangen, Mainz, Halle and Leipzig (Photo) are really booming. The secret of their success is the close links between higher education, science and in- dustry – something that also makes them attractive for inter- national jobseekers. In Erlangen an innovative micro-climate of small and medium industrial businesses, service providers and startups has grown up around the Siemens group and the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. 2 Rich and varied cultural life There aren’t many countries which can boast as many top- flight museums as Germany. Every year over 100 million people visit Berlin’s Museum Island, Munich’s three major art galleries (known as “Pinakotheks”) and Dresden’s Old Mas- ters Picture Gallery (Photo). Cultural life is thriving in smaller towns and cities, too, thanks to the federal principles which underpin Germany as a country. Every five years the interna- tional art world turns its gaze on Kassel, for example, for the documenta art show, while Wagner fans travel from all around the world to the Bayreuth Festival in Franconia. 4 </div>

The Urach Waterfalls in the Swabian Jura could be straight out of “The Lord of the Rings”, while the Elbe Sandstone Moun- tains of Saxony (Photo) offer breathtaking views of gigan- tic rock formations. Our 16 national parks and 9,000 nature reserves provide safe spaces where protected species can live away from human interference. Walking and hiking trails stretching over 300,000km are the perfect way to enjoy the great outdoors. 4 Warm, welcoming people Germany is a modern and cosmopolitan country. It’s no accident that we’re among the top destinations for inter- national students, fourth in the world rankings (behind only English-speaking countries). Our young people love mak- ing new friends, they speak English and enjoy finding out about other cultures, international sport, music and techno logical innovations. Here in Germany, people can choose for themselves how to live their lives, creating a rich and diverse tapestry of lifestyles and attitudes. Almost one in four Germans comes from some kind of migrant background. The state is committed to ensuring that everyone can live freely and independently. 3 A safe place to live Germany is one of the safest countries in the world. Crime rates are relatively low and the police and security forces work closely with international partners. The detection rate for crimes stands at just under 60%, and Germany ranks 15th in the Global Peace Index. Munich, Augsburg, Wiesbaden and Mainz rank as Germany’s safest major cities. Compared to other countries around the world, Germany is rarely im- pacted by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. 5 5 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E IT Industry Coding is a big part of Reshma Sahadevan’s life. “When I’m programming I’m thinking about solu­ tions to complex problems. It's my passion.” Reshma earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Kerala in 2015 and went on to work for several international companies in Mumbai. Now aged 32, she has been working as a software devel­ oper for Copart Deutschland since 2022. Based in Düsseldorf, Copart runs online auctions for used and damaged cars. When asked why she moved to Germany, Resh­ ma explains, “The German tech industry is ro­ bust and dynamic and is well known in India for its strengths in innovation and quality.” She found her job through the Hand in Hand for In­ ternational Talents programme run by the Ger­ man Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federal Employment Agency. With funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, the Hand in Hand pro­ gramme recruits skilled workers to German businesses. According to Bitkom, which represents the Ger­ man IT and telecoms industry, over a million people like Reshma work in the sector in Ger­ many. There are over 96,000 businesses working in the industry with an estimated market size of €223 billion for 2024. In 2022 the Federal Gov­ ernment adopted a new digitalisation strategy with the aim of delivering a wide range of pro­ jects to put Germany at the forefront of digit­ alisation. This means Germany needs skilled IT professionals. According to Bitkom, German businesses are currently looking to hire 137,000 specialists. “I can work inde- pendently and my company is very international.” R E S H M A S A H A D E VA N , IT expert 8 </div>

S A R G O N S H A M U A I L , Painter and decorator Con- struction The white walls of the first flat which Sargon Shamuail rented in Germany were what in- spired him to take up his current trade. He wanted a bit more colour in his new home when he and his wife moved in with their two children after coming to Germany from Iraq in 2009. “I didn’t know anything about painting, so I said to myself, I’m going to learn.” He asked building firms if they needed workers. “My neighbour and former German teacher helped me with the applications,” the 46-year- old recalls. In the end he was taken on by a small building firm in Frankfurt. “My colleagues taught me wallpapering, painting, varnishing and plastering. They also helped me when I had to deal with bureaucracy and with writing letters.” His colleagues are now his friends. People like Sargon are in high demand, as building companies in Germany are currently looking for over 15,000 new staff. International workers already make up 23% of people em- ployed in the industry. Building and construc- tion is a significant factor in Germany’s econ- omy, with a turnover of over €100 billion a year. Video: find out more 9 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E Video: find out more Health- care Mary Celine Santiago remembers her first day at work in Germany very well. Now aged 30, Mary Celine Santiago came to Germany from the Philippines five years ago. Even though she had taken a German language course, she just could not remember some of the words she needed for work at the Bonn University Hospi- tal. “But the patients were so understanding,” she says. “They helped me find the right words. It was such a lovely experience.” Now the nurse speaks fluent German and knows all the medical terminology she needs. Her patients value her work, as do her bosses. So much so, that Mary Celine Santiago was promoted to deputy ward manager only two- and-a-half years after starting work as a nurse. She’s also taking a training course for middle managers, paid for by her employers. “It really shows they value me,” she says. Santiago came to Germany through the Triple Win programme, which is run by GIZ and the Federal Employment Agency on behalf of Ger- man employers to encourage applications from international nurses and carers. Experts pre- dict Germany will need an additional 150,000 people in these careers by 2025. Mary Celine Santiago praises the working con- ditions at Bonn University Hospital and wants to remain here. She feels at home now, and: “I’m proud of what I have achieved.” “There are plenty of opportunities for professional development in Germany.” M A RY C E L I N E S A N T I AG O, Nurse 10 </div>

The same year he completed a Hauptschule school leaving certificate. With his certificate in hand, he found an apprenticeship as a truck driver with DB Schenker in Arnstadt in Thuringia. “I wanted to become a truck driver because I like travelling and meeting new people,” says Kingsley, who got a permanent job right after completing his training. According to the Ifo Institute, over half of Ger­ many’s logistics firms are facing staffing short­ ages. Although the sector is growing, freight vol­ umes continue to increase, so the shortages persist. With a turnover worth €319 billion in 2022 and over 3 million employees, logistics is the third­largest sector in the German economy. In order to ensure supply security and economic performance now and in future, German logistics companies are looking all over the world for workers like Kingsley Igbinovia.

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E Video: find out more When he was only eight years old, Vladimir Gaal disassembled his family’s computer. A broken phone and rusted hair drier were unscrewed and investigated. “Even then I was fascinated by the interior life of the technology around me,” says Vladimir Gaal, who comes from Campinas in south­east Brazil. “To me the computer mother­ board looked like a tiny city. I wanted to know how it all worked. It’s still the same today. The electronics engineer has worked for Logatec, a medium­sized family business in Kölleda in Thurin­ gia, for a year now. “In Brazil Germany is known for the quality of its craftsmanship and good working conditions. That's why I came here. Now I want to stay on, thanks to my friendly colleagues and the varied nature of my job.” Around 5.57 million people like Vladimir Gaal work in Germany’s skilled crafts and trades. Electronics engineers are in particularly short supply right now. There are a lot of opportunities for skilled workers in fields such as automation technology, energy supplies, and machinery and plant engineering. Germany has a long tradition of the skilled crafts and trades, which are con­ sidered a future­proof sector with many different career opportunities thanks to factors such as a wide range of training and professional develop­ ment. Worker who have mastered their trades can also set up independently. Germany offers many language courses and in­ tegration programmes for international skilled workers to help them communicate at work and settle down in Germany. Vladimir Gaal was one of the international skilled workers who took a course at the Federal Employment Agency, where he learned a lot about Germany’s working culture and society. But not everything he learned proved to be true. “I was told that Ger­ mans don’t like to act spontaneously and that you should plan everything in advance. But on my second day in Kölleda one of my German colleagues knocked on my front door and asked if I wanted to go for a drink and a chat – quite out of the blue! I think the best way to learn about many things is to experience them for yourself.” “In Brazil Germany is known for the quality of its craftsmanship and good working conditions.” V L A D I M I R GA A L , Electronics engineer 12 </div>

Her role is to en- sure that the jet and its systems meet the nec- essary safety and performance standards and fulfil the requirements set by air travel authorities. Bilge Atici brings 14 years of experience in the aerospace industry to her work. She gained bachelor's and master’s degrees in engineering along with an Executive MBA from Ankara Uni- versity. But she was always drawn to working in Germany. “Germany has one of the world's largest economies and offers many different development opportunities for engineers,” she says. There is an urgent need for skilled workers like Atici in the aerospace industry. According to the Association of German Engineers (VDI), there are 170,000 vacancies, but the number of people starting engineering courses is drop- ping, so companies are prioritising recruiting skilled workers internationally. One in ten en­ gineers in Germany already comes from abroad, according to a VDI survey. Bilge Atici also benefits from working in an international environment in Lilium’s head office in Weßling near Munich. “There are people from over 50 countries here,” she says. “Every day I learn something new from so many different back- grounds. That’s incredibly valuable.” Video: find out more “I like the work­life balance in Germany.” B I LG E AT I C I , Engineer 13 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E Stepping up the pace and stripping away bureaucracy Text: Uta Rasche The new Skilled Immigration Act is clearing away obstacles and placing greater value on work experience. From exciting professional prospects to social security and beautiful environments to live in, Germany has a lot to offer. On top of this, it is one of the driving forces behind many global trends. Things are changing rapidly, particularly in the future­oriented fields of digitalisation and renewables, de­ velopments which are already evident in Germany’s employ­ ment market. To deliver this transformation, the Federal Gov­ ernment is making it a priority to bring in the expertise and engagement of skilled workers from around the world. Whether you’re an IT technician, engineer, nurse or electri­ cian, there’s a warm welcome for you here in Germany. The way into Germany’s employment market is being made easier for skilled workers. The government amended several laws in 2020 to make it easier for qualified workers to emi­ grate to Germany. Now the newly expanded Skilled Immigra­ tion Act, is the logical next step as Germany continues its journey as a modern country of immigration from 2023 on­ wards. The new law includes numerous measures to make things easier for graduates and skilled workers with voca­ tional qualifications from outside the EU. Here’s an overview of the new rules on immigration for skilled workers. What will change in November 2023? Lower salary thresholds The new law lowers the salary thresholds for EU Blue Cards, which offer highly qualified people from outside the EU a route for migration. In 2023 someone earning €39,682.80 meets the threshold for an entry­level position in a shortage job. For other careers you need to show your annual income is €43,800 or more to get an EU Blue Card. These allow aca­ demics from outside the EU who have found a job in Ger­ many to live here with their families. Easier access for IT specialists without degrees IT specialists who do not hold university degrees can get an EU Blue Card if they have at least three years’ work experi­ ence, and the shortage jobs threshold applies to them. More shor tage careers Alongside maths, IT, science, engineering and medicine, skilled workers from the following career groups can get an EU Blue Card with the lower salary threshold: – Managers in manufacturing, construction and logistics – Managers in IT and telecommunications – Managers in childcare and healthcare – Vets – Dentists – Pharmacists – Nurses with a degree – Teachers and nursery staff in school and non­school contexts 14 </div>

You do not need to apply for a work permit. If you have held an EU Blue Card from another EU member state for 12 months or more, you can move to Germany with­ out needing a visa. However, you do have to apply for a Ger­ man EU Blue Card from the immigration office once you have moved here. Lowering barriers to families If family members of a skilled worker who holds an EU Blue Card are living in a different EU member state, it is now easier for them to move to Germany. The family does not need a visa and can now live here under their residence per­ mit from the other EU country. They no longer need to prove that their home is large enough and that they can cover their living costs. It will also be easier for people who get a resi­ dence permit from 1 March 2024 to bring their parents and in­laws to Germany. What will change in March 2024? Skilled workers with practical work experience Workers with two years’ practical experience in non­regulat­ ed careers will be able to work in Germany without needing to get official recognition for their qualifications. They only need to hold a degree or similar vocational qualification rec­ ognised by the country where the qualification was awarded. The vocational training must have lasted at least two years. Certain qualifications from German Chambers of Commerce Abroad may be valid. Nurses and carers from non-EU states In future, people who have trained as nursing assistants for only one or two years will be able to take on permanent jobs in the healthcare system in Germany. This was previously only possible for nurses who had completed three years of training. The condition for this is that applicants have trained as a nurse/nursing assistant in Germany or hold a foreign nursing qualification which is recognised in Germany. Residence for recognition of foreign vocational qualifications In regulated professions such as nursing and education, skilled workers will still be able to travel to Germany before their vocational qualification has been officially recognised. This opportunity is now being widened to other groups. To take advantage of the new rules, the skilled worker and their employer enter into a “recognition partnership”. The require­ ment for this is that the skilled worker holds a state­recog­ nised vocational qualification (of at least two years’ duration) from their country of origin, or a university degree. The skilled worker also needs German language skills. Skilled workers in regulated careers should get individual advice from the Working and Living in Germany hotline. Further in­ formation on how foreign vocational qualifications are recog­ nised can be found here. What will change in June 2024? Finding work with an Oppor tunity Card The Opportunity Card allows skilled workers from non­EU states to look for work in Germany. If they hold a degree or vocational qualification equivalent to a German qualification, these workers can get an Opportunity Card with no strings attached. The only requirements are that they hold a degree from a foreign university or a vocational qualification of at least two years’ duration (where the qualification is recog­ nised in the country where the study took place), or a voca­ tional qualification issued by a German Chamber of Com­ merce Abroad. In addition, they will need basic German skills to A1 level or English skills at B2 level. They will be awarded points for their qualifications, language skills, work experience, age and connections to Germany, along with the career potential a partner who is moving to Germany with them. At least six points are needed to get an Opportunity Card.

Federal Labour Minis- ter Hubertus Heil explains how this will work. He also tells us how equal opportunities will play a part in the new plans and how important it is to have a genuine- ly welcoming culture. Mr Heil, you have described the new law as “the cornerstone of a modern country of im- migration”. What are the distinctive features of a modern country of immigration in your view? A modern country of immigration opens doors and hearts. It demonstrates a genuinely welcoming culture in everyday life with few bureaucratic ob­ stacles. We need skilled workers from all around the world as our own population is growing older and there are already many vacant positions here. Other industrialised countries are facing exactly the same challenges. Germany is an attractive country, but we are competing with many other countries with longer traditions of migration, ones where the weather might be better or the lan­ guage easier. That’s why we need to make active efforts to recruit highly qualified immigrants and 17 make it as easy as possible for them to start life in Germany. That’s exactly what our new law does. We’re low­ ering barriers, stripping away bureaucracy and fo­ cusing much more on people’s potential. This has made the legal framework more modern than ever. At the same time we also want to make it easier for people to integrate into everyday life. We want people to feel comfortable here, become part of our society and want to stay here. Lan­ guage skills are crucial in this regard, but social engagement and a welcoming culture at work also matter as well. Why does Germany need skilled workers from abroad? Right now there are 17 million vacant positions in Germany. At the same time, over the next few years there will be more people retiring than young people entering the workforce. That means there is already a shortage of workers and that gap is only going to widen in the long term. We cannot close that gap just from our “own re­ serves” alone. True, there is still untapped poten­ tial around employment for women, older people and people with disabilities. But we still need mi­ gration on top of this. Given that finding skilled workers often takes a long time, we now need to pull out all the stops, both by making migration easier and making better use of our own reservoir of talent. </div>

What does the govern- ment hope to achieve by introducing it? The Opportunity Card allows you to find a job when you are here in Germany. Non­EU citizens can now stay in Germany for up to a year to find a job, before it was six months More people will also be able to get a residence permit. If you can find a job which is suitable for your qualifications this year, you will be able to extend your stay in Germany. However, Opportunity Cards are only available to people who can cover their own living costs, either through savings or with a part­time job. Cardholders will be able to work up to 20 hours a week in jobs which are unrelated to their quali­ fications. The Opportunity Card also allows cardholders to work on a trial basis for up to two weeks in a job which matches their qualifications. “We’re lower- ing barriers, stripping away bureaucracy and focusing much more on people’s potential.” H U B E R T U S H E I L 1.7 million jobs are vаkаnt in Germany. How is the new law making migration easier for skilled workers? In future, migration for skilled workers will be based on three pillars. Firstly, your qualifications. If you’ve already found a job and hold qualifications which are recognised in Germany, it will be easier to get a work visa. In particular it will be easier to get the coveted “blue card”, as we’re reducing the level of the minimum salary required. Secondly, your experience. We’re opening up new pathways for migration for work purposes for people with professional qualifications and/or appropriate professional experience. Even if their degree or qualification is not recognised in Ger­ many, they can get working visas and go into employment straight away. Thirdly, your potential. This pathway will help people find work. We have created a new “Opportunity Card” which is available to people if they have not yet found a job but who can contribute promising potential. These people can now live in Germany for at least a year in order to find a job which is suitable for their qualifications. We’re also clearing away barriers which slowed immigration in the past, such as procedures for getting qualifications rec­ ognised. In some cases we’re scrapping the requirement for exams, and in others it will be possible to take examinations once you’re in Germany, instead of having to take them be­ forehand. We’re also making it easier for people to bring their families to Germany. All in all we’re proud to say the new rules are both ambitious and balanced. We’re protecting new arrivals against salary dumping and exploitation – after all, opportunity and protec­ tion must go hand in hand. That’s the principle which under­ pins our welfare state. 18 </div>

You have personally tried to recruit skilled workers on trips to India, Brazil and several other countries. What reactions did you encounter? What are the most important arguments you put forward when promoting Germany? Almost without exception the reactions were positive. Many young, motivated and well educated people would love to come to Germany, either because there is a lack of pros- pects for them at home or because of the opportunities which Germany offers them such as around professional training and development. Sometimes people mentioned the good security situation here and opportunities to bring their family with them. There are many great reasons to come to Germany: regulat- ed working conditions, diverse career opportunities and strong science and industry. Skilled workers can benefit from these in their own professional advancement. In addition to this there is our social security system such as health insur- ance, good opportunities to bring your family to Germany, and free education. The latter point is particularly important for young families and foreign students as well. 19 </div>

FAQ The essential questions about finding a job in Germany How do I find a job? “Make it in Germany” is a job site where you can find vacancies that the employer has specifically confirmed are open to applications from skilled workers from abroad. The Federal Employment Agency has an office dedicated to supporting international and skilled work­ ers: the Zentrаle Auslаnds­ und Fаchvermittlung (ZAV). The office provides help with finding work. You can find various contact options at: ↗ www.mаke-it-in-germаny.com/de/service/kontаkt Under what conditions can I work in Germany? Skilled workers who want to live and work in Germany for the long term require a working visa. In future, the new Skilled Immigration Act, which was passed in 2023, allows people to come to Germany on an “Op­ portunity Card”, even if they have not yet received a firm job offer. A points­based system which takes into account qualifications and experience (amongst other things) makes it possible for applicants to demonstrate their potential. Skilled workers with university degrees can apply for EU Blue Cards. These residence permits make it easier to bring your family into the EU, for ex­ ample, and reduce the period before you are eligible for permanent residence. Do I need a visa to travel to Germany? Most people from outside the European Eco­ nomic Area and Switzerland need a visa to travel to Germany. You will need to apply for a visa before travelling. You must do this in per­ son at the German embassy or consulate in your home country responsible for visa applications. Where can I find advice and support in my home country? Points of contact are shown on the world map on Make it in Germany. The Goethe­Institute also pro­ grammes in some countries to help you prepare for integrating into German life : ↗ www.mаke-it-in-germаny.com/service/ berаtung-аnlаufstellen/weltweit ↗ www.goethe.de/de/vorintegration Do I need to get my qualifications officially recognised? The new Skilled Immigration Act provides conditions where people with career experience can move to Germany even if they hold a vocational qualification which has not been officially recog­ nised in Germany. They are allowed to work in “non­regulated professions” such as management, IT and the food industry. However, if you want to work in a regulated profession such as those in the healthcare sector, you absolutely must get your qualifications recognised. Skilled workers can use the Recognition Finder to check if they need to go through the professional recognition process. ↗ www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/html/en/index.php 2222 </div>

It is also a major language of trade and commerce in Central and Eastern Europe. While English is widespread in many in­ dustries and in science and academia in Germany, you won’t get far in many careers if you can’t speak any German at all. German skills are par­ ticularly important wherever you come into direct contact with customers. They are also vital for you and your colleagues to understand each other. “Employers value the high levels of motivation of skilled workers who have migrated to Germany,” says Dr Martin Noack an expert in training and employment at the Bertelsmann Foundation. “The percentage of employees who hold foreign pass­ ports has almost doubled since 2009,” he says. Germany’s shortage of skilled workers is a great opportunity for migrants. “If they have the neces­ sary specialist skills and can speak German as well, the number of jobs open to them goes up by a third,” Dr Noack adds. “Learning some specialist vocabulary even before you come to Germany can give you a boost when finding a job.” D R M A R T I N N OAC K , Employment and training expert Goethe-Institut – German at work Having German skills at level B1/B2 is usually enough to start integrating into your new job. Training expert Dr Noack advises skilled workers who are thinking about starting work in Germany to focus on career­related content at an early stage when learning German. Self­tests like meine­berufserfahrung.de and additional skills tests like MySkills can help you identify your own professional strengths and focus your language learning on these areas. “Learning some specialist vocabulary even before you come to Germany can give you a boost when finding a job,” says Noack, whose team analysed over 48 million job adverts for their Job Monitor, which came out in 2022. German skills are in particularly high demand in the tourism and hospitality sectors, as well as transport and logistics. If you do want to get a foothold on working life in Germany, you’ll find plenty of opportunities to learn German. The “Ankommen” app helps you start learning words and phrases at home. The Goethe­Institut also offers exercises tailored to specific fields, making it easier to communicate in the workplace. In addition, adult education cen­ tres in Germany run work­related language courses, while part­time courses offered by the Federal Employment Agency allow those in em­ ployment to take part. In the end, German is just like any other language: give it a go, and don’t worry about making mistakes! The best way to practice what you’ve learned is by talking to oth­ ers, be that in the office, the workshop, the bak­ ery or a café.

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E Working together on the energy transition Text: Verena Kern Demand is higher than ever for international skilled workers to fill the growing number of “green jobs” in Germany. If someone asked you to imagine the energy transition, you’d probably think of wind turbines and solar panels. But for Constantin Eis, skilled workers come to mind. Constantin Eis runs the green energy supplier Lichtblick. He wrote an open letter to Robert Habeck, the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. “No extra pairs of hands, no transition” was the title of the letter. The sig­ natories to the letter included managers of businesses like 1Komma5°, Thermon­ do, PowerUs and Installion. They are calling for nothing less than “turbocharging skilled workers” in order to accelerate the energy transition. Their proposals range from speeding up the qualification process for solar panel installers, to making it easier for skilled workers to migrate to Germany. The letter from the energy sector is not only a sign of importance of the issue, but it also demonstrates how businesses are willing to break new ground. Eis justifies his initiative with the argument that “The shortage of skilled workers is currently one of the biggest challenges to climate protection.” But the Lichtblick boss and his fel­ low campaigners aren’t just making a series of demands. They have a proposal to make, too. “In our letter we wanted to support government initiatives to deal with the shortage of skilled workers and signal our readiness to deliver solutions quickly with all involved,” Eis says. “Having enough qualified staff is critical to making the most of the huge potential of climate protection technologies,” he adds. 24 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E ↑26% growth in solar panels around the world in 2022 – a new record That potential really is enormous. Climate­friendly technologies are enjoying a boom all over the world, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency IEA, which records record highs in 2022 for the expansion of renewable energy, including a 26% growth in solar panels. Investment in clean energy rose by 15% and is worth $1.6 billion. Sales of electric cars also rose sharply, more than trebling their market share within two years. The trends are so dynamic that the IEA’s conclusions are positive, even where international climate action is con­ cerned. “Rapid progress of key clean energy technologies shows the new energy economy is emerging faster than many think,” they say. In Germany, too, demand for solar panels, electric cars and heat pumps is higher than ever. Interest in energy transition technologies is rising, both in business and the general public, according to a study by Agora Energiewende. The charit­ able thinktank analyses progress in transforming energy and industrial systems, and also surveys the public on their attitudes to the issue. Their conclusion? “The topic of the energy transition is firmly embedded in the minds of the general pub­ lic.” When energy prices spiked in 2022 due to the war in Ukraine, climate and environmental protection were always among the most pressing issues for people in Germany. The thinktank argues there is “broad social backing for the energy transition.” You might say Germany is the birthplace of the energy transition – after all, this is where the term was “invented”. The German word “Energiewende” combines two previously unconnected ideas to create something new, a memorable way of de­ scribing the transformation of our energy supplies, leaving behind fossil fuels in 26 </div>

The term attracted attention around the world and found a place in a number of lan- guages, and even English, where “Energiewende” is some- times used in scientific publications. Now similar terms exist for other fields relevant to climate protection such as trans- port (“Verkehrswende”), heating (“Wärmewende”), and farming (“Agrarwende”). “Energiewende” first emerged in Germany in the late 1970s. The anti-nuclear movement were the first to call for the re- structuring of the energy systems, demanding a “transition” to new forms of energy. On the one hand they were calling for an end to nuclear power, which at the time played a major role in Germany. On the other hand, their demands also included using energy more economically and reducing dependence on imported fuel, especially oil. At around the same time, a new Öko-Institut was set up in Freiburg to focus on environmental issues. It also emerged from the anti-nuclear movement and is now a leading en- vironmental research institution. In 1980 the new institute published a report with the forward-looking title of “Energy Transition: growth and prosperity without oil and uranium”. The key points of the report were that wind power, solar power, hydropower, biomass and geothermal energy should replace fossil fuels, accompanied by energy efficiency as an additional measure. Florentin Krause, one of the authors of the report, once described energy efficiency as “the trump card if you want to make climate goals safe and af- fordable.” Today, these are the key elements of Germany’s energy transition policy. In the ten years after 2000, the proportion of green electricity in Germany’s supply rose from 6% to three times that level. But there was still a long way to go to get from calls and con- cepts to the point of concrete policies. Committees advising the Federal Government warned of the risks of climate change, while a 1987 inquiry into provisions to protect the earth's at- mosphere recommended substantial cuts to greenhouse emis- sions. Shortly before this, the “Spiegel” current affairs maga- zine prompted a public debate on the issue through its headline story entitled “The Climate Catastrophe”. By passing the Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2000 the Federal Government created a principle where green electricity was given priority, along with increasing subsidies. The im- proved conditions made it more attractive for many businesses and members of the public to invest in the energy transition. Soon, wind turbines and solar panels could be seen across the whole country. In the ten years after 2000, the proportion of green electricity in Germany’s supply rose from 6% to three times that level. Today, it is just under 50%. Speeding up the expansion of green energy quickly reduced prices for what had initially been expensive technologies. Renewables were now competitive, not just here but around the world. Nowadays they are often cheaper than fossil fuels, costing a few cents per kilowatt hour for solar power and land-based wind turbines. 27 </div>

The number of jobs in the renewable energy sector has also grown in Germany. IRENA estimates the cur­ rent figure is around 350,000. In order to fill these and future jobs, Germany needs skilled workers from abroad. One of the energy experts who has already settled down in Germany is Jаmаl Benfаydаh from Morocco. Jamal Benfаydаh is an electrical engineer who has been working for Schoenergie in Rhine­ land­Palatinate since March 2021. Schoenergie em­ ploys 190 people to build solar panels, solar parks, batteries and charging infrastructrure. Jamal Benfay­ dah works as a technical project planner for solar in­ stallations in open spaces. “My dream was to be in­ volved in big projects and my dream has come true. Climate goals German Federal Government By 2030 80% of electricity from renewables 15 million electric cars 6 million heat pumps By 2038 end of generating electricity from coal By 2045 climate neutrality Thanks to this, Germany’s renewable energy law became the driving force behind the global energy transition. Without it, the current boom in climate protection technology would be impossible, or at least it would be greatly delayed. If you ask climate scientists what makes them optimistic that the goals of the Paris Agreement can be achieved, they point to the rapid decline in prices for energy transition technologies. These technologies are now almost unbeatable for price, so it is now a realistic option to give up harmful forms of energy. But the energy transition isn’t just about providing cli­ mate­neutral energy and helping protect the climate. It’s also about boosting domestic value creation, allowing the public to participate in generating energy, and even driving job creation. Around the world 13 million jobs have already been created through the energy transition, according to the latest report by IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency. IRENA also stresses that opportunities for women, young people and members of minority groups are much better in this field than in conventional energy 28 </div>

German businesses are looking for more skilled workers like Jamal Benfаydаh following the Federal Government’s approv­ al of ambitious climate goals and the decision to set a new course to accelerate the energy transformation. Germany aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2045, 5 years ahead of the European Union. According to government plans, 80% of Germany’s electricity needs will be met from renewable sources by 2030, 15 million electric cars will be on German roads, and 6 million heat pumps will have been installed. In addition to this, the production of green hydrogen will be ac­ celerated over the next few years. Germany will pull the plug on coal­fired power stations by 2038 at the latest. The last nuclear power stations went offline in the spring of 2023. All this will lead to strong growth of jobs in the energy transi­ tion sector in the coming years, and demand for skilled work­ ers is already high. Many sectors of the green economy are looking for new workers, from skilled crafts and trades to en­ gineering, construction, IT, energy and electrical technology and many others. They all need “additional pairs of hands”, as the open letter from energy transition businesses put it. These jobs offer great career prospects as well as making a key contribution to driving the energy transition. Jamal Benfaydah has worked in the German solar industry since 2021. 29 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E “Naturalisation is a catalyst for integration” The opportunity to hold two passports would further increase the attractiveness of German citizenship for skilled workers, says sociol- ogist Yuliya Kosyakova from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Interview: Helen Sibum Professor Kosyakova, how many skilled workers will Germany need in the next few years? Every year we need around 400,000 skilled workers in order to keep our earning potential constant. And that’s just the net figure: we need 400,000 people to actually remain in Ger­ many. To put that into perspective, that's about the same as the working­age population of Luxembourg. These skilled workers have to come from abroad as Germany’s domestic potential is pretty much exhausted. The employment rate among women is now high and we can’t just keep increasing the pension age whenever we feel like it. That means we ur­ gently need to promote migration among skilled workers. If we can’t close the gap, we’re heading towards a very prob­ lematic situation. IAB predictions indicate that, without mi­ gration, there will be 80 pensioners for every 100 people in employment in 2060. In 1990 the ratio stood at 30:100. The migration of skilled workers can significantly slow this increase. 30 What role does working migration currently play in Germany? It is already a major factor. Almost half of workforce growth in recent years came from foreign citizens. The majority of these were migrants from within the EU, although their num­ bers are dropping significantly. At the same time, the number of non­EU citizens coming to Germany for work remains low. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees put the figure at 40,000 in 2021. How have German politicians and the wider public’s attitudes to migration changed in recent decades? Germany’s route to becoming a nation of immigration has gone through several stages. Sociologists describe the period from 1955 to 1973 as a time of recruitment and “gastarbeiter”, or “foreign workers”. This phase was shaped by the agreement which Germany signed with several Euro­ pean countries in order to attract workers. Germany’s econo­ my was booming and demand for workers was high. A period of consolidation between 1973 and 1980/1981 was followed by a period of resistance, when recruitment was suspended due to the oil crisis, economic crisis, recession and the threat of unemployment. A period of acceptance began with the formation of a new government in 1998. From a sociological perspective, we have been in the final stages of becoming a modern country of immigration since 2015. </div>

The sociologist is originally from Ukraine but came to Germany over 20 years with along with a group of other Jewish refugees. The state cannot impose cohesion, but government actions do have a symbolic effect. Do the planned changes to citizenship law have that kind of effect? Plans to make naturalisation easier and quicker are certainly a positive sign. Af­ ter all, we don’t just want skilled work­ ers to come here: we want them to stay on, too. Naturalisation is considered the greatest privilege which a state can be­ stow, as it makes the recipient a mem­ ber of society with all the rights and obligations that come with that. Yet the proportion of workers who become naturalised citizens re- mains low. Will the reforms be able to change this at all? purposes collapsed during the pandemic. We will now have to wait and see how the figures have changed since then. What is your assessment of the new Skilled Immigration Act? The new law includes a raft of minor changes and a few major ones. The minor changes in­ clude reducing the income threshold for the EU Blue Card, which is the migration pathway for highly qualified citizens of non­EU countries, to a realistic level. There are also plans to make it easier for immigrants to bring their families with them. The social elements of the law are very important both to recruiting skilled workers and en­ couraging them to remain here. All this is worthwhile, but it does not go beyond the framework of existing laws. On the other hand, one new element is the provision to allow skilled workers to skip the process of having their qualifications as­ sessed for comparability with German qualifications if their salary is above a certain level. That said, apart from the Blue Card, the salary thresholds are still too high. It is unlikely that you would come to Germany and start earning such a big salary straightaway. However, in my view one of the most innovative elements of the new law is the Opportunity Card. If you hold a recognised vocational qualification or degree abroad, you can travel to Germany for up to 12 months to find a job – as long as you have enough points in categories such as work experience and language skills. What do you think of these changes? They’re moving in the right direction. They create new access opportunities and make existing opportunities easier. What's very important is that the new law no longer places such emphasis on having qualifications recognised in Germany. It was often the cases that foreign degrees were not recog­ nised at all or only elements were recognised. This led to skilled workers needing to gain additional qualifications which prolonged the process, or even derailed it completely. So it does lower some barriers, but when you look at the de­ tail they are still too high. It remains to be seen if people abroad will understand the wide range of regulations in Ger­ many. After all, that’s vital if we are to redress the shortage of skilled workers. I think they will. Research shows that there are two things which are particularly important in making naturalisation more attractive for skilled workers: shortening the applica­ tion process and providing the option of dual nationality. The planned changes include both of these. They permit natur­ alisation after five years instead of eight, and three years in exceptional cases. The intention is for dual or multiple na­ tionalities to be recognised. That greatly increases the chance that people, including skilled workers, will apply for naturalisation. How does naturalisation factor into integration? Naturalisation is a catalyst for integration, as scientific re­ search has now shown. Naturalised migrants possess better language skills, higher levels of education, more social con­ tacts and are also more strongly integrated politically. The new Skilled Immigration Act was adopted in June 2023 following reforms in 2020. How do you assess the developments of recent years? The 2020 reforms brought no fundamental changes to the legal system, such as moving towards a points system. They did open up the system somewhat by putting people with non­academic qualifications on the same level as those with university degrees. The reforms also created opportunities to come to Germany before someone's vocational qualifications had been recognised. However, these were all minor reforms which have failed to demonstrate a quantitative effect thus far. Indeed, the opposite is true, as immigration for work 31 </div>

It nes­ tles against the Nile to the east, and largely consists of im­ pressive houses and tree­lined streets. In English, “Maadi” means “ferries”, which is apt given the role of the Egyp­ tian­German Centre for Jobs, Migration and Reintegration (EGC). The centre is located in the heart of Maadi and its job includes helping Egyptians prepare for migrating to Germany – helping them make the crossing, so to speak. Spread over several floors of a building, the EGC includes a generously sized visitors area on the ground floor with offices for staff upstairs. It started work a little less than two years ago, but that re­ mained almost entirely virtual due to the pandemic. Since then the doors have opened for real and interest is high in what the EGC has to offer. Strictly speaking the centre has three different but connected tasks. Firstly, it exists to help people returning from other countries to reintegrate into Egypt; secondly, it helps prepare people for work in Egypt; and thirdly it advises and supports skilled workers who are making their way to Germany. Initially the centre focused on the jobs market for local residents and returners, but since early 2023 migration through regular routes to Germany has become established as a third pillar of its work. 12,000 individual consultations since opening in 2021. Huge interest “Since we opened in 2021 we have conducted over 12,000 in­ dividual consultations,” says Shahira Wassef who handles the migration portfolio for GIZ, the German society for inter­ national development partnerships, in Egypt. “That’s an enormous number.” Given the high levels of interest and a target audience which is not limited to Cairo, there are now 14 regional offices spread across the whole country. These are always located in areas where socio­economic factors such as unemployment and poverty drive up the risk of irregular migration. The aim is to offer training and qualifi­ cations to improve people’s chances in their local jobs mar­ kets, but the offices also provide information on employment opportunities in Germany. On the German side, GIZ runs the centre on behalf of the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Develop­ ment. They work with representatives of the Egyptian Minis­ try of Emigration and Egyptian Expatriate's Affairs. This con­ stellation alone shows that these services are in the interest of both sides. Egypt is looking for ways to give its young population a better education and get young people into work, both at home and abroad. Germany needs skilled workers and is therefore prioritising targeted migration for work purposes. The EGC provides advice to visitors accord­ ing to their situation and what they want. Sometimes it con­ cerns courses and training, such as how to improve some­ one's skills as an electrical mechanic. Sometimes the EGC provides information on requirements for entering Germany. Many people, and young people, have been able to get valu­ able help from the centre. 3333 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E “We stopped talking about ‘brain drain’ years ago,now we're talking about ‘brain gain’.” S H A H I R A WA S S E F, GIZ Pilot project opens up migration routes Through a pilot project entitled THAMM, GIZ is working with the Federal Employment Agency to identify exactly what people need to make the leap to Germany and how best to make that leap. The project was commissioned by the Fed­ eral Development Ministry and the European Commission. It is running in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco and is preparing skilled workers and apprentices to spend the next part of their life in Germany, along with providing help with official matters such as visas. The project is mainly focusing on the hotel and hospitality, baking, electronics, construction, and industrial mechanics industries. The project has already sent some applicants to Germany. One of them is Hisham Ayman, a young Egyptian who now lives and work in Kitzingen, a small town in northern Bavaria, where he's training to be a chef. He already speaks good German after starting at the Goethe­Institut and is now re­ fining his language skills in Germany. He likes his new sur­ roundings. “I can experience new things and learn new skills,” he says, both at work and elsewhere. What he values about his apprenticeship is how it combines work in the classroom and the kitchen. He says his goal is to pick up as much as he can, complete his training and then to stay on in Germany and open his own restaurant in ten years. Prospects like this are tempting to many young people in Egypt. However, as Shahira Wassef explains, the programme has “far more applicants than places.” So far, 200 men and women have been able to take part, “but demand is much higher than that,” Shahira Wassef says. The project has re­ ceived 2,000 applications in Egypt alone. Findings from THAMM are being incorporated into the advice provided by the EGC and are multiplying its impact. “We’re using it to test how vocational mobility can work,” says Wassef, who also explains that there are plans for the GIZ to hand over this service to bodies within the partner country. Shahira Wassef handles the GIZ’s migration portfolio in Egypt. 34 </div>

Providing knowledge and suppor t across Africa Though Egypt has a long association with diaspora (an esti­ mated 10% of its population live abroad) it is not the only country which wants to explore and share the opportunities of legal migration. Centres for migration and development al­ ready exist in countries such as Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan and Indonesia, or are under construction. They are all now paying special attention to mi­ gration to Europe. Development Minister Svenja Schulze visited the centre in Ghana along with Labour Minister Hubertus Heil in February 2023. She summed up its goals thus: “Managed properly, mi­ gration holds enormous potential for the economic develop­ ment in our partner countries and in our own country as well.” She went on, “the existing Ghanaian­German Migration Ad­ vice Centre has previously focused on helping returning Ghanaians to reintegrate. We want to turn this one­way street into a two­way road.” Shahira Wassef also rebuts the accusation which is some­ times made that prosperous countries pick off well educated people for their own purposes. Even the preparation for working abroad boosts people's qualifications, to say noth­ ing of working for a German company. Alongside learning the language, experiencing Germany's culture and making con­ tacts, Egyptians in Germany learn many additional skills which they can bring back home later. “We stopped talking about ‘brain drain’ years ago,” Wassef says. “Now we're talk­ ing about ‘brain gain’.” 35 </div>

Text: Klaus Lüber During a summer school in 2019 Richard Gao, a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science at the world­re­ nowned University of California San Diego, got to know a group of German scientists from Tübingen. The team leader gave a talk on how artificial intelligence can be used in neuro science research. Gao loved it. Then, when he had to choose where to continue his research as a Postdoc, he ultim ately opted for the small university city near Stuttgart. “For a while now Tübingen has been known around the world as a top location for AI and neuroscience,” he tells us. Gao has been a member of Professor Jakob Macke’s research group into machine learning in science at Tübingen’s AI Center since 2021. The tie­in between the University of Tübingen and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems is part of a nationwide network which currently consists of six AI research hotspots. The Federal Government wants to use these as part of its AI strategy to raise the profile of German AI research. The government’s stated goal is to encourage AI professionals from around the world to make a career in Germany. This goal not only applies to undergraduate and postgraduate students, but also at the level of university professors, where an add­ itional 150 jobs have been planned. 37 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E Top talent from abroad The Tübingen AI Centre has become an established address and is considered as one of Europe's strongest research clusters in the field of machine learning. “We now have a whole host of very high­calibre research scientists here who have come to us from top institutes abroad,” explains Philipp Hennig, Professor of Methods of Machine Learning at the University of Tübingen. “Many of the best international stu­ dents are often in the position to choose whichever leading university they want to go to, so that can be a reason for some of them to come to us.” Varied AI research While the Tübingen AI Center focuses on developing so­ called ‘robust learning systems’ or learning algorithms which can successfully deal with unexpected external influences, the five other competence centres each are focusing on a different aspect of AI research. The centre which takes the broadest approach is the German Research Center for Artifi­ cial Intelligence, which has sites in Kaiserslautern, Saar­ brücken, Bremen and Berlin. Research scientists from 60 countries work there on a wide range of application cases for AI. The Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence is working on the areas of work, health and mobility and is researching new approaches to human­machine interaction. Scientists at the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD) are particularly interested in the question of how to design complex AI systems in a more transparent way. “This is one of the essential conditions for the level of trust we can place in these systems, and ul­ timately for the success they enjoy in the market,” explains Dr Jack Thoms, Managing Director at BIFOLD. The Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Dresden/ Leipzig is concentrating on how to create new computer in­ frastructure which can process data more efficiently. The sixth AI centre in the consortium is the LAMARR Institute at the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Informa­ tion Systems in Sankt Augustin near Bonn, which is digging into strategies to transfer research into business. AI in the economy Transferring research into practice is something where more and more German companies are making a significant contri­ bution. Bosch, for example, has set up its own research de­ partment for AI, with around 100 AI research scientists working at their main office in Reutlingen near Stuttgart. “Every year we fund around 40 PhD students at German uni­ versities. They carry out their research right here with us and can use our resources,” explains Dr Michael Pfeiffer, head of AI research at Bosch. “Above all, outstanding AI research needs computing horsepower. As a business, we’re investing in that on a massive scale,” he says, adding that the invest­ ments are also paying off in terms of attracting skilled AI professionals. “We have a high rate of AI experts who stay on with us after completing their PhDs,” Pfeiffer says. 150 new AI professorships are to be created through the govern- ment’s AI strategy. The German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence specialises in many different areas. Here, young scientists are training machines to behave like people. 38 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E AI research doesn’t only take place in universities like the Tübingen AI Center (shown here). Many businesses are also re- searching all aspects of artificial intelligence. But Bosch is not alone in investing in training and skilled pro­ fessionals. Innovation Park AI has only just opened in Heilbronn. The aim there is to use funding from the Schwarz food manufacturing group to create one of Europe’s largest AI ecosystems. Also involved in the project is Aleph Alpha, an AI startup from Heidelberg. It is one of the few European firms that can keep pace with the current leader among AI language models, ChatGPT from the US firm Open AI. Unlike its competitors, Aleph Alpha works with an AI system which produces results that are transparent to users. Transparency of this kind could prove to be a genuine innovative advan­ tage, particularly for use at scale. The Cologne­based AI company DeepL is also keeping up with international competitors. It offers an AI­based translation service which is considered more powerful and accurate than Google Translate, the comparable service from the US company. And DeepL has no trouble finding out­ standing AI talent. According to their CEO Dr Jaroslaw Kuty­ lowski, they benefit from the huge pool of skilled professions “right on our doorstep.” Just in the area around Cologne, there are 47 higher education institutions and 31 research institutions with 17,000 people studying IT subjects. Aleph Alpha is very happy to be in Heilbronn, too. “We’re in the ideal place here to increase our strength on the scientific side,” says Jonas Andrulis, founder of Aleph Alpha. Within the next 12 months he intends to double the company’s headcount to 120 people. Find out more about AI: German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence Tübingen AI Center 40 </div>

Based in Bern and trained as an archaeologist, Gino Caspari is a co­founder of GeoInsight, a startup which aims to set new standards in assessing risks from natural disas­ ters and the affect of climate change. GeoInsight started work in spring 2022 as a spin­off from Ruhr University Bo­ chum. The international team of entrepreneurs works 100% remotely from locations in Germany, Portugal and Switzer­ land. They use AI to generate new learnings from the grow­ ing flood of geographical data which ranges from satellite imagery to photos on social media. “At the heart of this innovation is the development of a data structure which can be combined and integrated with geo­ graphical data of all different kinds,” Caspari explains. “Ma­ chine learning makes it possible to identify structures and patterns which would be very hard to spot using traditional geo­information systems.” Even users without high levels of specialist knowledge can evaluate large quantities of data. Right now the team is in talks with the European Space Agency with a view to the ESA providing its satellite imagery directly via their platform. “That would massively increase the usefulness and value of the data,” Caspari adds. Their model is just as interesting to international companies which are monitoring epidemics, climate change or food se­ curity, as it is to the finance and insurance industry, government agencies and governments. “For instance it can help reinsurers to estimate potential losses due to a disaster, regardless of whether it’s a fire, flood or an earthquake,” ex­ plains one of the project’s co­founders, Dr Michael Jendryke. After spending several years abroad, the geomatics expert now runs the business side of the startup from Germany. He met his co­founder Gino Caspari when they were research­ ers at Wuhan University and he has known the company’s other co­founder Dr Ana Gago da Silva from when they worked for the UN in Gen eva. “I looked for team members who I have known for a long time, whom I trust and who have the knowledge and tenacity to see something like this through,” he explains. “That’s particularly important when you’re working remotely and don’t see each other every day.” The term startup describes a young business no more than 12 years old. Innovative startup­founders invigorate the economy and are considered to be key to social progress. 2,000 startups listed in the German Startup Monitor for 2022. Coworking spaces are often a great place for startup founders not just to start work but also find inspiration. 42 </div>

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E The German Startup Monitor listed 2000 startups in 2022 and around 4,800 founders in Germany, employing 34,539 staff. Just under half of the startups are working on AI which plays a major role in their business model. This was followed by Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things. So­called “green startups” make up just under 30% of all innovative new busi­ nesses in Germany, and a third of these have close links to scientific research. Many universities in Germany help early­career academics interested in setting up their own businesses with making their business ideas a reality. The WORLDFACTORY pro­ gramme at Ruhr University Bochum is focusing on the inter­ national market. “These startup hubs play a vital role, par­ ticularly during the initial phase,” says Dr Ana Gago da Silva. The data scientist has lived in France and Switzerland but now works for GeoInsight from Portugal. “They create op­ portunities for networking, while promoting collaboration, building partnerships and providing robust infrastructure for startups,” she says. Right from when her team were applying for funding through EXIST research transfer, they were able to access professional support. “Submitting an application including a business case and pitch is a pretty big piece of work,” Jendryke recalls. Dealing with legal and regulatory is­ sues proved to be a major challenge for the international team during the project. “In Germany we have a strong fund­ ing system to support startups which is very important to de­ veloping all levels of a business,” says João Carlos dos San­ tos Manuel, a software developer. “Without that support, I think most startup ideas would never get off the ground,” he adds. Having an international background is a strong selling­point for the young company. A study by the Bertelsmann Stiftung found that international startup founders not only contribute language skills, but also valuable skills and experience which are important when it comes to successfully expanding an innovative business. The founders of GeoInsight share this view. “We all have experience of different cultural and lin­ guistic spaces,” says Gino Caspari. “The moment we start dealing with international organisations we meet team lead­ ers from India or research group leaders from China. Being able to know and evaluate what makes them tick can make the difference whether the door opens for us or not.” 30% of startups in Germany are &quot;green&quot; startups.

D E – T H E M A G A Z I N E People from many different countries work side­ by­side in Martin Kohstall’s workshop: Togo, Sene­ gal, Syria, France, Ghana, Croatia and Greece. The master joiner takes commissions for interior design and his team combines older, more experi­ enced carpenters with young apprentices and as­ sistants. One such is Abdulrahim Alshallah, who came to Munich from Syria in 2018. He trained as a carpenter in Syria, but there was no formal ap­ prenticeship like there is in Germany. Martin Kohstall employed him even though he did not hold a formal qualification. &quot;I need nice young people who want to work,” says the man from Mu­ nich. “Their nationality doesn’t matter to me. The world has always been a rich and varied place for me.” Applicants for a job with Martin start by complet­ ing a period of work experience. “Their attitude to work is vital. Applicants must have the will to learn,” he stresses. “They also need to fit as a person.” He places less weight on German lan­ guage skills. For the past 15 years he has regular­ ly employed skilled workers from abroad, and There are plenty of openings in the skilled crafts and trades. 46 23employees work at Martin Kohstall's carpentry firm, around half of whom come from outside Germany. around half of his 23 staff are from outside Ger­ many. “They are the future of the skilled crafts and trades,” he says emphatically. “For years in Germany we've had a shortage among the next generation.” There’s a desperate need for workers across all the skilled crafts and trades, as Stefan Gustav from the Koblenz Chamber of Crafts explains. The shortage is affecting commercial and technical careers, food production, metalwork and con­ struction. “I’m often on the phone with companies who have connections with a country and know people there who they want to bring to Germany,” Gustav says. He specialises in providing official recognition for foreign vocational qualifications. Currently he is supporting a local refrigeration firm which wants to employ a man living in Iraq as a mechatronics engineer for refrigeration technol­ ogy. He will have to get his qualifications ana­ lysed when he arrives in Germany to assess whether he has adequate skills. The number of vacancies in the skilled crafts and trades in Germany has exceeded the number of unemployed craftsmen and women for several years. There is a particular shortage of skilled workers who already hold a vocational qualifica­ tion or professional experience. The Chambers of Crafts advise businesses on how to handle appli­ cations and regulations. They provide support to both sides, as jobseekers can get tips on where to look for work. </div>

They also employ more refugees, especially where the firm already has experience of working with for­ eign workers. They are also more likely to recruit new staff through their own existing employees and other personal contacts. Regional factors matter, too, as migrants are more likely to be em­ ployed in areas where the staff shortage is par­ ticularly acute. According to master carpenter Martin Kohstall, bureaucracy is not too much of an obstacle to taking on apprentices he from abroad. “New ar­ rivals in Germany need a residence permit and if that needs extended, that’s just something you have to deal with yourself,” he explains. He doesn’t consider the examinations at vocation­ al colleges to be too much of a barrier, either. Germany has a well­known system of two­track vocational training. Apprentices, known as “Azubis” for short, spend one or two days a week “There’s a desperate need for workers across all the skilled crafts and trades.” S T E FA N G U S TAV, Chamber of Crafts adviser 47 </div>

They can then put their new knowledge to use straight away in the workplace. The exams are of course more challenging for people who do not speak German as a first language. Even here, though, Martin Kohstall says a lot depends on how the college and lectures deal with the problem. “The majority of international apprentices pass their exams,” says Kerstin Brandt, an advisor at the IHAFA integration project which offers training in the skilled crafts and trades for refugees and asylum seekers. Funded by the Lower Saxony Ministry of Social Affairs, Labour, Health and Equality, the project places immigrants into ap­ prentices for skilled crafts and trades and sup­ ports them until they have completed their train­ ing. “Being able to speak German is important,” Brandt emphasises. “It matters when talking to colleagues on the building site or in the workshop just as much as it does in the vocational college.” The IHAFA project’s work includes supporting ap­ prentices whose language skills are not up to the demands of the workplace or examinations. Train­ ees can improve their language skills through tu­ toring programmes and vocational language courses which they take alongside their work. Adel Hammamy managed to get his language skills up to scratch. Adel comes from Syria and had only lived in Germany for three years when Martin Kohstall took him on as an apprentice. “I read a lot and watched TV to try to learn the lan­ guage better,” says the 35­year­old. He has now worked as an assistant joiner at the Mu­ nich­based firm for 16 years. The good mood that Hammamy brings to the workshop seems infec­ tious. He says that you always work as a team in the skilled crafts and trades, and he like that. It’s also the best way to learn German. He’s happy that he stuck at his vocational training, which wasn’t always easy. “As a carpenter, you’ve al­ ways got a good future,” he says.

For young people in Turkey, completing your high school diploma puts you on a conveyor belt to­ wards university. “Academic education is highly valued here,” says Oya Dinçdoğdu. On the one hand, that’s no bad thing, but many businesses are critical. “School leavers may have all kinds of theoretical knowledge, but they have next to no experience of how to use this in practice,” Dinçdoğdu explains. “Here it is quite rare to find a connection between theory and practice as you would in German vocational education.” Germany is providing support to numerous countries to set up two-track vocational training systems which link theory and practice. Building links with Germany’s jobs market Every year since 2017 the Skills Expert initiative has helped ten German Chambers of Commerce Abroad to expand activities linked to vocational training. The project focuses on the needs of Ger­ man companies in Turkey and their local business partners. Dinçdoğdu and her team at AHK Turkey joined the programme in January 2023. They are testing the potential for preparing foreign skilled workers to make the switch to the German labour market. They are also adding extra modules to the curriculum which are targeted at showing equiva­ lence with German reference careers. “That means young people in Turkey not only get a high­quality practice­oriented vocational qualifi­ cation in Turkey, but that same qualification is their link to the German labour market. Oya Dinçdoğdu is working on changing that. As a skills expert at the AHK Turkey, the German­Turk­ ish chamber of industry and commerce, she is calling for a two­track vocational education sys­ tem which follows the German model. She also advises businesses, schools and university on how to create the necessary structures. Her job is funded through the Skills Experts programme of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Cli­ mate Action. Depending on their chosen direction of travel, young people have good prospects with German companies in Turkey. If on the other hand they want to make their career in Germany, their quali­ fication will make it easy for them to gain a foot­ hold there. “Turkey has huge demographic poten­ tial,” says Dr Thilo Pahl, head of the AHK. Twenty million young people in Turkey go to school com­ pared to Germany’s eight million – and the two countries’ populations are roughly the same. 51 </div>

Much like in Turkey, vo­ cational education in Brazil has tended to be fo­ cused on schools and universities. In partnership with the vocational college at Colégio Humboldt, a German school abroad, students can now ac­ cess targeted qualifications and a two­track education. Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action is not the only government ac­ tor in Germany which is campaigning to promote regular migration for work purposes.

The first step involves the Federal Employment Agency and local agencies selecting candidates and putting them in touch with com­ panies in Germany. Support for the young people continues after they get to Germany, such as through introductory workshops and consulta­ tions. In the period since 2020 THAMM has helped 700 potential jobseekers from 3 countries to prepare for migration, such as by offering lan­ guage courses to B1 level and intercultural train­ ing. Within Germany the project has thus far placed 412 apprentices and skilled workers in training positions or employment. The state of Thuringia is also targeting recruiting workers to the skilled crafts and trades with its EU­funded CRAFT project. As part of the project, the Erfurt Chamber of Commerce is helping busi­ nesses find trainees and skilled workers interna­ tionally. CRAFT is focusing on Vietnam, Georgia, Moldova and Kazakhstan. Young people aged be­ tween 18 and 27 get the chance to apply for an apprenticeship or even for a job businesses in Thuringia. Places on the scheme are awarded in partnership with vocational and language schools, secondary schools and universities, and with government ministries and embassies in the applicants’ countries of origin. The success of international training initiatives like Skills Experts, THAMM and CRAFT depends on levels of awareness and acceptance for dual two track training options in the countries concerned. With this in mind, the APAL project focuses on building training partnerships in Latin America so as to intervene at an early stage and inform young people about this career pathway. APAL prepares school students and alumni of German “PASCH” schools abroad from El Salvador and Mexico for two­track training in Germany. PASCH is an initiative by the Federal Foreign Office in co­ operation with the German Central Agency for Schools Abroad, the Goethe­Institut, the German Academic Exchange Service and the Educational Exchange Service. Since 2021 PASCH, the Goethe­Institut Mexico, the Federal Employment Agency and hospitals in various German cities have worked hand­in­hand with APAL. The pro­ gramme provides skilled nurses and workers in medical technology careers. Numerous projects provide German courses and training to ensure migrants have the language skills and cultural understanding they need to make a successful start in Germany. 53 </div>
